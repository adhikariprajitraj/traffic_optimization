Data Description
The data/network_data.csv file represents the transportation network, containing information about nodes, edges, and capacities. It is crucial to perform a detailed analysis of this data before applying optimization techniques.

Modeling and Optimization
The models/optimization_model.py file contains definitions of linear and nonlinear optimization models. These models will utilize network flow theorem and PyTorch to optimize traffic flows and minimize congestion.

Testing
The tests/test_optimization_model.py includes unit tests for the optimization models to ensure their functionality and reliability. It is recommended to run tests after making changes to the model files to avoid any disruptions in the workflow.
